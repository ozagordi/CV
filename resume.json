        "summary": "I am a data scientist and statistician with a ten year experience in interdisciplinary projects and a feeling for communicating with people whose background is different from mine. I developed a [leading software](http://ozagordi.github.io/shorah/) (over 100 academic citations) in the analysis of NGS data and worked at pipelines facilitating the introduction of new technologies into routine diagnostic practice. In 2014, together with some colleagues, I founded [enGene Statistics](http://www.engene.ch), a fully owned company that allows us to provide statistical consulting services in bioinformatics outside of our institutional research projects. Our clients include research groups at University of Zurich and University of Basel.",
