### Areas of competence
**data analysis — biostatistics — bioinformatics —  big data — Bayesian —
effective presentations — communication skills**

### Technical skills
**Python — R — Linux/Unix — C/C++ — scripting — data visualisation**

#### Examples of past data analytic projects

-   [ShoRAH](https://github.com/ozagordi/shorah), a software implementing a Dirichlet
    process mixture model (a Bayesian nonparametric model for unsupervised learning).
    The tool is written mainly in Python with parts in C++ and comes with its
    [documentation](http://ozagordi.github.io/shorah/).

-   [Accompanying material](https://github.com/ozagordi/FluAbs) for a paper where I
    performed parametric and nonparametric regression in R, data visualisation with
    ggplot2.

-   [Data sharing policy](http://ozagordi.github.io/DataSharingPolicy/), a slide deck
    to raise awareness on good practice for data collection and sharing.

-   [VirMet](https://github.com/ozagordi/VirMet) is a software suite to analyse
    large sequencing datasets (~10 Gb) in efficient way. Written in Python and
    Unix shell, it includes a small pandas [example](https://github.com/ozagordi/VirMet/blob/master/tax_orgs.py).
    Another tool where I made more extensive use of pandas library is currently
    being considered for licensing.

### Languages
Italian (maternal language), English, French, German (basic)

#### My story
I am a data scientist and statistician with a ten year experience in
interdisciplinary projects and a feeling for communicating with people whose
background is different from mine.
I developed a [leading software](http://ozagordi.github.io/shorah/) (over 100
academic citations) in the analysis of NGS data and worked at
pipelines facilitating the introduction of new technologies into routine
diagnostic practice.

In 2014, together with some colleagues, I founded
[enGene Statistics](http://www.engene.ch), a fully owned company that allows
us to provide statistical consulting services in bioinformatics outside of our
institutional research projects. Our clients include research groups at
University of Zurich and University of Basel.


Positions
---------

### 2014 - present: co-founder and partner at [enGene Statistics](http://www.engene.ch)

-   Contact with clients, analysis and development of the pipelines, project
    management and presentation of the results

### 2011 - present: scientific collaborator at University of Zurich, [Institute of Medical Virology](http://www.imv.uzh.ch)

-   Member of the unit for Development and special diagnostics

-   Developed, tested and maintained pipelines to analyse NGS data (tens of
    gigabytes per experiment) for clinical research projects; I configured and
    maintained the computational infrastructure for analysis and backup

-   Assisted other groups in the institute in statistics, data analysis and data
    visualizations

### 2008 - 2011: post-doc at ETH Zurich, [DBSSE](http://www.bsse.ethz.ch)

-   Member of the Computational Biology group

-   Developed the software suite
    [ShoRAH](http://ozagordi.github.io/shorah/), in its field one of the most
    popular tools and considered **state of the art by scholars in the field**

-   Data scientist in several interdisciplinary projects, I built a **strong
    and close interaction with partners from other departments**

-   Representative of scientific staff in a committee hiring a full professor

-   Teaching assistant in several undergraduate courses
