#### My story
I consider myself a *multicultural* and *multi language* data scientist
/ statistician. With a 10 year experience in computational biology,
during which I have collaborated in many interdisciplinary projects, I
developed a feeling for **communicating with people whose background is
different from mine**. These projects lead to publications in
**biomedical journals** and to the development of a **leading software**
in the analysis of NGS data. I believe in continuing education and I
like taking online classes on topics both related and unrelated to my
job (like data management in clinical research and finance).
